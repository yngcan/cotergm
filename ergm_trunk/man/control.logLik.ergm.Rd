\details{
    This function is only used within a call to the \code{\link{logLik.ergm}} function.
}
\arguments{
  \item{nsteps}{Number of geometric bridges to use.
  }
  \item{MCMC.burnin}{Number of proposals before any MCMC sampling
    is done. It typically is set to a fairly large number.
  }
  \item{MCMC.interval}{Number of proposals between sampled statistics.
  }
  \item{MCMC.samplesize}{Number of network statistics,
    randomly drawn from a given distribution on the set of all networks,
    returned by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
  }
  \item{obs.MCMC.burnin, obs.MCMC.interval, obs.MCMC.samplesize}{
    The \code{obs} versions of these arguments are for the unobserved
    data simulation algorithm.
  }
  \item{MCMC.prop.weights}{Specifies the proposal distribution used in the MCMC
    Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.  Possible choices are \code{"TNT"} or 
    \code{"random"}; the \code{"default"} is one of these two, depending on the
    constraints in place (as defined by the \code{constraints}
    argument of the \code{\link{ergm}} function), though not all weights
    may be used with all constraints.  
    The \code{TNT} (tie / no tie) option puts roughly equal weight on selecting a
    dyad with or without a tie as a candidate for toggling, whereas the
    \code{random} option puts equal weight on all possible dyads, though the
    interpretation of \code{random} may change according to the constraints in
    place.  When no constraints are in place, the default is TNT, which 
    appears to improve Markov chain mixing particularly for networks with a
    low edge density, as is typical of many realistic social networks.
  }
  \item{MCMC.prop.args}{An alternative, direct way of specifying additional arguments to proposal. 
  }
  \item{warn.dyads}{Whether or not a warning should be issued when
    sample space constraints render the observed number of dyads
    ill-defined.
  }
  \item{MCMC.init.maxedges}{Maximum number of edges expected in network.
  }
  \item{MCMC.packagenames}{Names of packages in which to look for change statistic
    functions in addition to those autodetected. This argument should not be
    needed outside of very strange setups.
  }
  \item{seed}{Seed value (integer) for the random number generator.  
    See \code{\link[base]{set.seed}}
  }
