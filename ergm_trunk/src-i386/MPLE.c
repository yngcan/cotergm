 void MPLE_wrapper

 Wrapper for a call from R.  
 Only find the MPLE, so no MCMC stuff is necessary. 

 Re-Written by David Schruth to add compression:
   Since there are often many different 0->1 dyad changes that
   result in identical change statistic vectors, this routine
   now returns only the unique change statistic vectors in the 
   covmat matrix, along with a separate vector, weightsvector,
   giving the number of repetitions of each unique set of change
   statistics.  Note that two sets of statistics are considered
   unique in this context if the corresponding response values
   (i.e., dyad values, edge or no edge) are unequal.
   The value maxDyadTypes is the largest allowable number of
   unique sets of change statistics.
 Re-rewritten by Pavel Krivitsky to make compression fast. ;)

 void MpleInit_hash

 For finding the MPLE, an extra bit of initialization is required:  
 we must build the matrix of covariates to be used in the logistic 
 regression routine.  This matrix has #rows equal to the number of 
 possible edges in the network (n choose 2 for an undirected network) 
 and #cols equal to the number of network statistics in the model, 
 which is also the number of parameters.  The row for each edge in 
 the matrix should contain the changes in each of the statistics that 
 would occur if the given edge is toggled from 0 to 1, leaving all 
 other edges as they are in the observed network.  The response vector 
 for the logistic regression is simply the vector of indicators 
 giving the states of the edges in the observed network.

 It comes in two versions: one that iterates through all valid dyads,
 skipping those on the additional list, which is treated as a
 blacklist; and another that iterates only through dyads on the
 additional ist, which is treated as a whitelist.

/* Maps a dyad ID to a tail and a head, serializing them in a
   tail-major order.  Here, __s represent structural 0s.

   Note that both undirected and directed unipartite networks are
   serialized in the exact same manner. The t<h "filtering" or
   swapping must be done later. (The alternative appears to require a
   square root, which is inefficient.)
